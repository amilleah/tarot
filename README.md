## Installation

```bash
go install github.com/amilleah/tarot@latest
```

## Getting started

**keybinds:** Use "d" to draw a card, Use "r" to reshuffle.

**mouse-clicks:** Click the deck to draw a card, automatically reshuffles when all cards are drawn. Use "r" to reshuffle as needed.

## Troubleshooting

You'll want to set your terminal's line spacing to 1.0 to avoid gaps within the playing cards.
